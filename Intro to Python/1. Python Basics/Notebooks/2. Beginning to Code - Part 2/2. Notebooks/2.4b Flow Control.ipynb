    "# Python Flow-Control (Decision-Making) Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python programming, decision-making statements are those that **help in deciding the flow of the program**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, at times, you might want to execute a block of code only if a particular condition is satisfied. Well, in this case, decision-making statement will be of great help. Let us consider an example to understand this better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing to note about Python's control flow statements and program structure is that it uses **`_indentation_`** to mark blocks. Hence the amount of white space (space or tab characters) at the start of a line is very important. This generally helps to make code more readable but can catch out new users of python."

    "> The first thought that would pop up your mind is this - **\"If the number is divisible by 2, then it is an even number, else it is an odd number\"**. That's absolutely the right logic. But when this has to be coded, you will need the help of decision-making statements. To understand this, let's now look at how they function."
